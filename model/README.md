### `/model`

This folder contains Python notebooks for our code in building traffic accident prediction models. We developed several [models](https://kteo7.pythonanywhere.com/exploration#four) and found that displayed the best performance. A summary model performance is provided below. With further hyperparameter tuning, we belive we can yield better results.
