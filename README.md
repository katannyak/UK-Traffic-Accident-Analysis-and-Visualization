# UK Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization

## Project description



Our full analysis and visualization of UK traffic accidents and interactive tool to predict accident probabilities for a given route and a specified time can be found at our [website](https://kteo7.pythonanywhere.com/)

A nice description of this project is provided in this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/live-prediction-of-traffic-accident-risks-using-machine-learning-and-google-maps-d2eeffb9389e) written by colleauge Meraldo Antonio.

Data used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales/version/8)
